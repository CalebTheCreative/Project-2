## CHALLENGES FACED
* * *
Finding a way to connect the database and routes to each page using Handlebars with Sequelize proved to be very challenging, especially when it also involved adding the The Movie DB API into the mix on the Movie section.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
* * *
Our plans for future development of this project is to implement more activities like board games, video games, and cooking and add API calls to each of those new sections. We also would like to eventually add an option that randomly decides between the four options (boardgames, cooking, movies, videogames) for the user to enjoy.
